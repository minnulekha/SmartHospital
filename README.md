## 📌 Project Overview
**Smart Hospital** is an innovative AI-driven solution designed to eliminate physical waiting lines in healthcare facilities. By synchronizing real-time data, the system empowers patients to manage their time effectively, reducing hospital congestion and improving the overall patient experience.

### ⚠️ The Problem
Traditional hospital waiting rooms are often overcrowded, leading to:
* High patient frustration and "waiting room anxiety."
* Increased risk of cross-infection in confined spaces.
* Total uncertainty regarding actual consultation times.

### ✅ The Solution
Our platform leverages **Firebase Realtime Database** and **Google Cloud** to provide:
* **Live Wait-Time Estimations:** Patients know exactly when to leave home.
* **Dynamic Travel Alerts:** Integration with Google Maps Platform to calculate commute times.
* **Digital Ticketing:** A seamless, paperless entry system for appointments.
